```r
# The corrected code uses parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations.
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

subset <- data[(data$x > 2) & (data$y < 9), ]

print(subset)

# Explanation:
# Without parentheses, R evaluates the conditions from left to right without considering operator precedence strictly. In this case,
# the code will first evaluate `data$x > 2` which results in a logical vector, then performs element-wise AND operation with the logical vector generated from evaluating `data$y < 9`.  If either of the conditions is false, the whole expression returns FALSE.
# Adding parentheses ensures the conditions are evaluated separately before the logical AND operation is performed, giving the correct subset.
